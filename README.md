# Handwritten Digit Recognition with MNIST dataset

This project aims to create a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model is trained and then exported for use in production. The ultimate goal is to have this model deployed on a website where users can drawn a number in a canvas of a handwritten digit and get a prediction from the model.
